# 🛡️ Decentralized Complaint Tracking System

> **A Transparent, Immutable, and Secure Public Grievance Redressal System built on the Ethereum Blockchain.**

---

## 📖 Project Overview
Traditional complaint systems suffer from opacity, data manipulation, and lack of trust. This project solves these issues by recording every complaint on a **Blockchain Ledger**. Once a complaint is filed, it cannot be deleted or altered by anyone—not even the administrator.

## ✨ Key Features
*   **🚫 Censorship Resistant**: Complaints are permanent and tamper-proof.
*   **🔍 100% Transparent**: Anyone can verify the history of a complaint.
*   **🎨 Modern UI**: Built with React.js, featuring Glassmorphism and Framer Motion animations.
*   **🐳 Dockerized**: Fully containerized for easy deployment anywhere.
*   **🔐 Secure**: Uses MetaMask for identity and smart contracts for logic.
